 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * Mjoin( PATL, tpmvUHN ) performs the following matrix-vector operation
 *
 *    x := conjg( A' ) * x,
 *
 * where x is an n-element vector and  A  is an n by n  non-unit,  upper
 * triangular matrix, supplied in packed form.
 *
 * This is a  recursive  version of the  algorithm.  For a more detailed
 * description of  the arguments of this function, see the reference im-
 * plementation in the  ATLAS/src/blas/reference directory.
